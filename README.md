# Animal Sound Simulation (Medium-Hard)

Concepts Used: Inheritance, polymorphism (overriding), abstract class
Description:
Create an abstract class Animal with:
- Name
- Abstract method MakeSound()
Create derived classes:
- Dog → "Woof!"
- Cat → "Meow!"
- Cow → "Moo!"
Write a method that takes a list of Animal and calls MakeSound() on each (demonstrate
polymorphism).
